## Introduction 🎙
TakuNet is a convolutional architecture designed to be extremely efficient when deployed on embedded systems. Extensive experiments on [AIDER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08716) and [AIDERV2](https://openreview.net/forum?id=8UgKEVu7up) demostrate that TakuNet is able to achieve near-state-of-the-art accuracy while being extremely efficient in terms of number of parameters, memory footprint and FLOPs among the competitors.

</div>

A deeper inspection on models performance on a few embedded devices such as Raspberry Pis and NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano show that TakuNet can achieve a very large speedup in terms of Frame per Second against competitors, mostly on recent embedded architectures.
Since TakuNet is trained with float-16 resolution, its optimization through TensorRT on NVIDIA hardware accelerator does not approximate the model weights.

## Installation ⌨️
TakuNet code exploits docker container to simplify code distribution and execution on different devices and hardware architectures. If you have already installed docker on your machine, you can skip the docker setup step.

This work was developed on a Ubuntu-24.04.1-LTS-based system with NVIDIA Drivers 560.35.03, equipped with an Intel i5 8600K, 16GB DDR4 2666MHz, NVIDIA RTX 3090 24GB. Training were performed on a different machine, composed of an Intel i7 12700F and NVIDIA RTX 4070ti Super.
On the other hand, experiments on Raspberry Pi(s) were conducted through the docker container running on Raspbian Bookworm, while NVIDIA Jetpack 6.1 was installed on the Jetson Orin Nano Devkit device. 

### Docker setup 🚢
1. Install docker on a Linux based machine possibly
    ```
    wget https://get.docker.com/ -O get_docker.sh
    chmod +x get_docker.sh
    bash get_docker.sh
    ```
2. Once docker has been installed, install [nvidia-docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) for GPU support
    ```
    curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
    && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
    ```
    update and install the nvidia container tool
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
    ```
    configure nvidia container toolkit
    ```
    sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```
3. Add required permissions to your user in order to perform actions with docker on containers
    ```
    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    newgrp docker
    ```

### Repository setup 📂
1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DanielRossi1/TakuNet.git
    ```
2. Build the docker container
    ```
    cd TakuNet/docker
    ./build.sh
    ```
3. Once the container has finished to build, run it. the run script supports directory mount through arguments. Directories are mounted in `/home/user/... `
    ```
    # Just run the container
    ./run

    # run the container and mount a directory (e.g. the one which contains the dataset). Here you will find AIDER in /home/user/AIDER
    ./run -d /home/your-username/path-to-data/AIDER
    ```

## Usage 🧰
The execution interface is really simple, it consists of a bash script which launches the main.py script, automatically loading the arguments and configurations specified in TakuNet's configuration file: `configs/TakuNet.yml`.
```
cd src
./launch.sh TakuNet
```

### Inference on Edge Devices 🔋
Embedded device inference scripts are located in the `embedded` folder, and require a proper configuration for each specific target device. The main configuration file is located in `embedded/configs/TakuNet.yml`. 
```
cd src
python3 embedded/main.py --cfg-path embdedded/configs/TakuNet.yml
```

<details>
  <summary><b>Inference configuration parameters ⚙️</b></summary>
The inference script has to adapt based on the target execution device. Thus you need to properly set a few parameters before launching the main script. 
<ul>
 <li><b>onnx_model_path</b>: where the exported onnx file is located</li>
 <li><b>engine_model_path</b>: where to store the TensorRT engine</li>
 <li><b>use_tensorrt</b>: wether to enable TensorRT, to be used only on Jetson devices (set to false on Raspberry Pi)</li>
 <li><b>fp16_mode</b>: true if your ONNX model is half-precision, else false if it has been exported with float-32 precision</li>
 <li><b>dataset_size</b>: test are conducted on randomly generated images (Torchvision FakeData) since we only want to measure inference speed. We set a number of images equal to 2600 and we drop the first 100 to compensate for the warm-up time</li>
 <li><b>img_size</b>: specifies the shape of the image (AIDER and AIDERV2 have different image shape)</li>
 <li><b>num_classes</b>: must be the same number of classes used during model training</li>
 <li><b>batch_size</b>: size of the batch of images to be processed in parallel (default 1)</li>
 <li><b>old_jetpack</b>: This option allows the model to be optimized using TensorRT on older Jetson devices. <i>Since this process is not straightforward, it may still encounter issues or errors. However, we encourage you to try it and report any issues you encounter.</i></li>
</ul>
</details>

## Additional Information 🔍

<details>
  <summary><b>TensorRT Export</b></summary>

To properly export a model exploiting TensorRT optimization, you need to set `use_tensorrt: true` in `embedded/config/TakuNet.yml`. The optimization should take place on the hardware device and requires onnx checkpoints to be already exported. 

You may face some issues when trying to compress the model through TensorRT on older Jetson devices such as _NVIDIA Jetson Nano (Maxwell)_ or _NVIDIA Jetson TX1_. In such cases, we suggest to lower the ONNX opset version, and set `old_jetpack: true` during inference.

<details>
  <summary><b>Performance on Edge Devices</b></summary>
Embedded devices require a stable input voltage to operate effectively. Improper use of power supplies, including unsuitable cables, may result in degraded and unstable performance. In some cases, such misuse could potentially cause permanent damage to the devices.

To maximize the performance of embedded devices, it is recommended to stop any application or service that may interfere with their operation. These can introduce unnecessary overhead or cause resource contention, potentially impacting the efficiency and responsiveness of the devices.

For optimal performance with TakuNet, we recommend performing a fresh OS installation. Furthermore, active termal cooling should be installed (if not already present) to avoid thermal throttling.
